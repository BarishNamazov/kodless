I need a spec that explains my document (e.g., UserDoc) and concept interfaces (e.g., UserConcept) very briefly (only public methods). For example, it might look like this for a given code:

UserDoc = {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}

UserConcept = {
  constructor: (collectionName: string) => UserConcept; // instantiates a new UserConcept with the given collection name
  async create: (username: string, password: string) => {msg: string, user: UserDoc}; // throws error if username already exists
  async getUser: (_id: ObjectId) => UserDoc; // throws error if user doesn't exist
  async getUserByUsername: (username: string) => UserDoc; // throws error if user doesn't exist
  async idsToUsernames: (ids: ObjectId[]) => string[]; // replaces non-existent user with "DELETED" username
  async authenticate: (username: string, password: string) => {msg: string, _id: ObjectId}; // throws error if can't authenticate
  async updatePassword: (_id: ObjectId, password: string) => {msg: string, user: UserDoc}; // throws error if user doesn't exist
  async delete: (_id: ObjectId) => {msg: string}; // throws error if user doesn't exist
}

Generate a similar spec for this code that has the same format as above. Remember, only public interfaces and methods. Don't reply with any other message, just the spec as in the example.
