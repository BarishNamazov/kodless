I am going to provide you with the specs of my concepts, which are modular pieces of my software. The app definition refers to their instantiation.

Each of the concept is located under "./concepts/{concept_name}". I am also going to provide you with the current app definition. Based on the prompt you will receive, generate a new app definition. Output only code and full file content (including imports).
